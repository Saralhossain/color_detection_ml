# color-detection-using-machine-learning
This is a machine learning project where one uses the system to scan and identify all the colors used there
<h1>What is Colour Detection?</h1>
Colour detection is the technique of detecting the name of any coloration. Simple isn’t it? Well, for humans this is a really clean venture however for computers, it isn't always straightforward. Human eyes and brains paintings collectively to translate mild into shade. Light receptors which can be found in our eyes transmit the signal to the mind. Our brain then acknowledges the colour. When you consider that adolescence, we've mapped certain lighting fixtures with their shade names. We are able to be using the relatively equal method to stumble on shade names.
About the Python Project
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The Dataset
Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can define a color? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each color’s values with their corresponding names. But don’t worry, we don’t need to map all the values. We will be using a dataset that contains RGB values with their corresponding names. The CSV file for our dataset has been taken from this link:

Colors Dataset

The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values. this data sets are categorized according to color codes.
